# Snow white project 

I wanted to do a data analyst/NLP project based on the reception and the discussion around the movie Snow White. 
I wanted to see how different events, like interviews of the cast, release of trailers and so on, affected the discussion 
around the movie. 

I think this could be a fun project, but I'm a bit reluctant to pursue it further at this time, since it seems 
so challenging to get good data to work with. The Reddit api seems like the best bet now, but IMDb and Twitter/X 
are a bit too expensive for a hobby project. 

Might revisit in the future, but this will not be a priority.
